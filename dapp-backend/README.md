# Gumball Dapp Backend

This backend is for the Gumball Example Dapp.

It contains all the restful elements your Dapp will need.

## Run

`npm run dev` to start the environment. 

Alternatively with Docker 

`docker build -t dapp .`

then run 

`docker run --rm -it -p 8080:8080 dapp` . 

It's also prepared to run in the cloud with that.
